This assignment consists of finding the size of a giant component of a Poisson random graph G(n,p) 
where n = number of vertices and 0 <= p <= 1 the probabilistic value having an edge between two vertices u and v in V.
First, by simulation method, we have to find the ratio of the size of the giant component to the size of the random graph
then by numerical method, we have to find the size of the giant component.
At last, we have to analyze the error.
